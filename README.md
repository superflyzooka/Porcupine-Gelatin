Description and useful info:

Your Gelo-pine: You control a small, adorable Gelo-pine creature on a colorful background.

  Movement:
      Use the W, A, S, D keys.
      Alternatively, use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
      Your Gelo-pine's speed increases as it levels up.

  Collecting XP (Experience Points):
      Move your Gelo-pine over the small gold circles (XP orbs) to collect them.
      Collecting XP helps your Gelo-pine level up.

   Collecting Memories:
      Move your Gelo-pine over the small purple squares (memory fragments) to collect them.
      Each memory collection will display a short narrative text on the screen, revealing bits of the game's lore.

   Chopping Trees (Resource Gathering):
      Find the green circles with brown trunks (trees) scattered around the map.
      Move your Gelo-pine very close to a tree.
      Press the 'E' key to "punch" the tree.
      Each punch will damage the tree (indicated by a small red health bar above it).
      Keep pressing 'E' until the tree's health is depleted.
      Once chopped, the tree will disappear, and you will receive Wood in your inventory.
      Chopped trees will respawn after a short delay.

Part 3: Understanding Your Goals (Game Systems)

"Gelo-pine's Journey" is designed as an idle-ish progression game with several interconnected systems:

  Player Progression (Leveling Up):
     Goal: Increase your Gelo-pine's level.
     How: Collect XP from gold orbs.
     Benefits: Each level increases your Gelo-pine's movement speed and unlocks access to new worlds. You'll see your current Level and XP in the top-left corner.

  World Exploration:
      Goal: Discover and travel to new environments.
      How: As your Gelo-pine levels up, you will automatically transition to new "worlds" with different visual themes (e.g., Grassy Plains, Sandy Dunes, Azure Coast). You can also manually teleport using the Teleport Menu (see Controls).
      Benefits: Each world has a unique aesthetic and might eventually introduce new resources or challenges.

  Architect of the Realm (Base Building):
      Goal: Build and upgrade your Gelo-pine's base.
      How: Currently, base upgrades are primarily done via commands (e.g., /baseupgrade) and require collected XP and materials (like wood, stone, metal) in your inventory.
      Benefits: A higher-level base is a foundation for future features like crafting stations or storage. In game way coming soon.

  Memory Weaving (Narrative):
      Goal: Uncover the story of your Gelo-pine's world.
      How: Collect purple square "memory" items. Each one reveals a piece of narrative.
      Benefits: Completing memory sets might unlock hidden content or deepen your understanding of the game's lore.

  Master of the Elements (Abilities):
      Goal: Unlock and use powerful elemental abilities.
      How: Abilities are unlocked at specific player levels, currently via commands (e.g., /unlockelement "Wind Gust"). Once unlocked, they can be used (e.g., /useelement "Healing Bloom"), but have cooldowns.
      Benefits: Elemental abilities provide temporary buffs or effects (e.g., speed boosts, healing) that can aid your journey. More in game ways coming soon.

  Guild of Influence (Faction System):
     Coming Soon...
        
   Dynamic Economy & Crafting Chains:
      Goal: Gather resources, craft new items, and manage your inventory.
      How: Collect wood from chopping trees. Other resources (stone, metal) can currently be added via admin commands (e.g., /collect stone 50). Use resources to craft items (e.g., /craft wood_plank) which process in a crafting queue.
      Benefits: Crafting allows you to create more advanced items or tools.

  Legacy System (New Game+):
      Maybe...
      
  Cosmic Alignments (Timed Events):
      Goal: Experience unique, temporary world events.
      How: These events trigger periodically on their own, or can be forced with the /cosmicalignment admin command.
      Benefits: Cosmic Alignments provide temporary global effects, such as increased item spawn rates or player speed boosts.

Inventory GUI:

  How to Show/Hide: Press the 'I' key (it acts as a toggle).
  Purpose: Displays the quantities of resources and crafted items you currently hold (Wood, Stone, Metal, Wood Planks, Basic Tools).
  Important: Movement is paused while the Inventory GUI is open.

Teleport Menu:

  How to Show/Hide: Press the 'T' key (it acts as a toggle).
  Purpose: Allows you to quickly jump between unlocked worlds.
  How to Use:
      When the menu is open, click on the name of the world you wish to travel to.
      Worlds that your player level doesn't meet the requirement for will appear greyed out.
  Important: Movement is paused while the Teleport Menu is open.
